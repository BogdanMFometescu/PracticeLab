# 1.	State the problem clearly. Identify the input and output formats.
# 2.	Come up with some example of inputs and outputs. Try cover all edge cases
# 3.	Come up with a correct solution for the problem. State it in plane English
# 4.	Implement the solution and test it using example inputs. Fix bugs
# 5.	Analyze the algorithmâ€™s complexity and identify inefficiencies
# 6.	Apply the right technique to overcome the inefficiencies. Repeat steps 3 to 6
