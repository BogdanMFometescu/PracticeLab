# You are given two positive integer arrays spells and potions, of length n and m respectively, where spells[i]
# represents the strength of the ith spell and potions[j] represents the strength of the jth potion.
# You are also given an integer success. A spell and potion pair is considered successful
# if the product of their strengths is at least success.
# Return an integer array pairs of length n where pairs[i] is the number of potions
# that will form a successful pair with the ith spell.
# Example :

# Input: spells = [5,1,3], potions = [1,2,3,4,5], success = 7
# Output: [4,0,3]
# Explanation:
# - 0th spell: 5 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [5,10,15,20,25]. 4 pairs are successful.
# - 1st spell: 1 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [1,2,3,4,5]. 0 pairs are successful.
# - 2nd spell: 3 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [3,6,9,12,15]. 3 pairs are successful.
# Thus, [4,0,3] is returned.
